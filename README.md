Hook for export MySQL + Script to import DB into MySQL
======================================================

Start Here
==========

wp-db.php
---------

Edit this file to provide your MySQL Database settings. This file should
be in the top folder of your project.

pre-commit.sample
-----------------
Change the name to `pre-commit` and put this file in the folder `.git/hooks/`

import-db.sh
------------
Use this file to import a MySQL Database. This file also uses the settings
provided in `wp-db.php`. Make sure this is also in the same directory.

To execute this script simply type:
    `./import-db.sh`

It will ask for a Database name which it will create and it is going to look for
a file with the same name provided as a Database in the `wp-db.php` file. This with 
the extension of `.sql` .
